# MNIST_NeuralNetwork
A flexible Neural Network for MNIST

### Usage
```
network.py —— three layers(one hidden layer) NN model with Cost_func = 0.5*(z-y) ** 2
python network.py

network_mini_batch.py —— NN model supported any hidden layers by configuring the parameters named "sizes"
python network_mini_batch.py

MNIST_tensorflow.py —— CNN model
python MNIST_tensorflow.py
```

  **Don't worry you have no train data in your local, it supports download the data set from the internet!.**

### Nerual Networks
You can define how many hidden layers and cells in this Neural Networks, it's flexible. You can make it by configuring the parameter "sizes".
